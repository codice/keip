# keip - Kubernetes Enterprise Integration Patterns

**The communication backbone for microservices, AI toolchains, and enterprise integration on Kubernetes.**

## What is keip?

keip (Kubernetes Enterprise Integration Patterns) is a Kubernetes operator that serves as the communication backbone for modern distributed systems. Whether you're orchestrating microservices, building AI toolchains, or handling traditional enterprise integration, keip transforms complex data flow challenges into simple, declarative configurations. 

Instead of writing, compiling, and deploying Java applications for service communication and data integration, you can now define Spring Integration routes as Kubernetes resources and let keip handle the rest.

### The Problems It Solves

Modern distributed systems often need to:
- **Microservices Communication**: Orchestrate complex service-to-service interactions, event streaming, and API workflows
- **AI Toolchain Coordination**: Connect AI models, data pipelines, feature stores, and inference engines in sophisticated workflows  
- **Enterprise Integration**: Move data between different systems (databases, message queues, APIs, files)
- **Data Transformation**: Convert formats (JSON to XML, CSV to database records, etc.) and enrich data in transit
- **Smart Routing**: Route messages based on content, rules, or dynamic conditions
- **Resilient Operations**: Handle errors, retries, and circuit breaking gracefully
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Scale integration workloads based on demand
- **Legacy Systems**: Bridge legacy systems with modern cloud applications and microservices

Traditionally, this requires:
- Writing Java code with Spring Integration
- Managing application lifecycle and deployments
- Handling scaling and resilience manually
- Complex CI/CD pipelines for every integration change

### The keip Solution

With keip, you define your integration logic in XML configuration and deploy it as a Kubernetes resource. The operator automatically:
- Creates and manages the underlying Spring Boot application with Spring Integration
- Provides access to the entire Spring ecosystem (hundreds of connectors, components, and enterprise patterns)
- Handles Kubernetes deployment, scaling, and lifecycle
- Provides cloud-native resilience and observability
- Enables runtime route updates without code compilation

## Key Features

- **üîß Kubernetes Native**: Fully integrates with Kubernetes using custom resources and scales with cluster capabilities
- **üå± Spring Ecosystem Powered**: Built on Spring Boot and Spring Integration with access to 300+ connectors and enterprise patterns
- **‚ö° No Code Compilation**: Define integration routes in XML and deploy instantly  
- **üìà Auto-Scaling**: Leverages Kubernetes scaling capabilities for integration workloads
- **üîÑ Runtime Flexibility**: Update integration routes without rebuilding applications
- **üè¢ Enterprise Ready**: Battle-tested Spring components with comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- **üìä Cloud-Native Observability**: Native Kubernetes monitoring and logging support

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.24+ recommended)
- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your cluster
- The `Make` utility for deploying the operator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codice/keip.git && cd keip
   ```

2. **Deploy the keip operator:**
   ```bash
   cd operator && make deploy
   ```

   This creates the `keip` and `metacontroller` namespaces and deploys the necessary components.

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   # Check metacontroller pod
   kubectl -n metacontroller get po
   
   # Check keip webhook pod  
   kubectl -n keip get po
   ```

### Your First Integration Route

Let's create a simple integration that prints a message every 5 seconds:

1. **Create the integration configuration:**
   ```bash
   cat <<'EOF' | kubectl create -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: keip-route-xml
   data:
     integrationRoute.xml: |
       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xmlns:int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration"
              xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                      https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                      http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration
                      https://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/spring-integration.xsd">
         
         <int:channel id="output"/>
         
         <int:inbound-channel-adapter channel="output" expression="'Hello from keip every 5 seconds'">
           <int:poller fixed-rate="5000"/>
         </int:inbound-channel-adapter>
         
         <int:logging-channel-adapter channel="output" log-full-message="true"/>
       </beans>
   EOF
   ```

2. **Deploy the integration route:**
   ```bash
   cat <<'EOF' | kubectl create -f -
   apiVersion: keip.codice.org/v1alpha1
   kind: IntegrationRoute
   metadata:
     name: example-route
   spec:
     routeConfigMap: keip-route-xml
   EOF
   ```

3. **Check the status and view logs:**
   ```bash
   # Check route status
   kubectl get ir
   
   # View the integration output
   kubectl logs -f deployment/example-route
   ```

You should see "Hello from keip every 5 seconds" printed regularly in the logs.

4. **Clean up:**
   ```bash
   kubectl delete ir example-route
   kubectl delete cm keip-route-xml
   ```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Container Images

The default keip container provides basic Spring Integration components. For advanced use cases, you can create custom containers with additional Spring Boot starters, Spring Integration components, or your own Java libraries:

1. Follow the instructions in [keip-container-archetype/README.md](keip-container-archetype/README.md)
2. Add any Spring Boot starters (Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, etc.) or custom dependencies
3. Update the `keip-controller-props` ConfigMap to reference your custom image
4. Restart the webhook deployment

### Debugging

View operator logs for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Metacontroller logs
kubectl -n metacontroller logs -f sts/metacontroller

# Keip webhook logs  
kubectl -n keip logs -f deployments/integrationroute-webhook
```

For verbose logging, set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in the webhook deployment.
